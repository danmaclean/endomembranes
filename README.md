## EndomembraneQuantifier

*Detailed Description*

1. Overview
We developed an automated bioimage analysis algorithm called EndomembraneQuantifier (EnQu), which can subtract background signal deriving from chloroplasts, deeper plant tissues and guard cells as well as detect genuine endomembrane compartment signals with high accuracy (Beck & Zhou et al., 2012). 

This script improves extensively from the endomembrane script (Salomon et al., 2010). The new features in EnQu include quantifying colocalisation of two-channel signals (GFP and chlorophyll autofluorescence), recording the imaging time, and analysing metadata of high content image datasets. EnQu were used to monitor flg22-induced FLS2 endocytosis over time, for example FLS2-GFP endosomes appeared at 30-45 minutes after applying flg22 and the endosome number increased significantly until reaching the peak at 60-75 minutes.
